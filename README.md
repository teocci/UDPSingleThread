## UDP Single Thread Audio Application for Android

### What is it?

This is a simple UDP audio application for Android, developed for my university project.

This application was designed to allow Android device users to engage in audio conversations over a local wireless network. The application has the ability to discover other devices on the network which are currently running the application. The devices will broadcast their basic info across the network and shown to other users who are currently running the application. Users can select one of the display names and attempt to initiate a voice call session with the chosen device.

### Requirements

* At least API Level: 16 Android 4.1 (JELLY_BEAN)
* A network that delivers UDP broadcast packets
* Devices must be on the same subnet
